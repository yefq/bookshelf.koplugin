-- Bookshelf is the topmost widget while it's on screen, so KOReader's
-- UIManager:sendEvent dispatches gestures to us alone -- FileManager
-- underneath us is NOT is_always_active, so its registered touch zones
-- (which include user-configured gestures from gestures.koplugin: corner
-- taps for night mode, edge swipes for brightness/warmth, etc.) never
-- fire on their own.
--
-- The fix: after our own children get first crack, walk FM's touch
-- zones for events we didn't consume. The walk is FILTERED to
-- KOReader-native zones only:
--
--   * FM's own zones (id prefix "filemanager_") -- the top-edge tap
--     and swipe that open the FM menu (filemanager_tap, _ext_tap,
--     _swipe on FM.menu); FM's east/west file-chooser swipe at the
--     FM root, consumed by our own SwipeNextPage / SwipePrevPage
--     above this walk before it would otherwise fire.
--
--   * gestures.koplugin zones whose id is a key in
--     fm.gestures.gestures -- i.e., gestures the user has actually
--     configured. The Gestures plugin is attached at fm.gestures by
--     FM's registerModule. Unconfigured gestures.koplugin zones are
--     skipped here (their handler no-ops via the action_list == nil
--     branch anyway).
--
-- Third-party plugins that register FM-level touch zones (SimpleUI's
-- bottom navbar / top header, etc.) are blocked across the whole
-- screen so a tap, hold, or swipe in a gap of our layout can't put
-- another widget in front of us. Stale state from that scenario was
-- the motivation: bookshelf's plugin-menu entry would still say
-- "Close Bookshelf" while bookshelf wasn't the visible widget,
-- because another plugin's zone had taken over the foreground.
--
-- We only walk FM's _ordered_touch_zones and FM.menu's -- NOT
-- fm:handleEvent -- to avoid propagating into FM's child widget tree
-- (which would risk activating the file list underneath us).
--
-- Replaces a prior geometric absorber + bottom-corner carveout: same
-- observable behaviour for stock KOReader paths (corner taps via
-- gestures.koplugin, top-edge tap/swipe to menu via filemanager_*),
-- with the third-party back door closed everywhere on screen rather
-- than just inside the absorbed [side_m, w - side_m] × [top_m, h]
-- rectangle. The hold_release leak from a pagination hold (chev
-- hold_callback rebuilds the footer, destroying the originating
-- Button, then the release arrives at the new Button) is still
-- handled: gestures.koplugin doesn't register hold_release types and
-- filemanager_* doesn't either, so the release finds no allowed zone
-- and falls cleanly to return false (the event dies; UIManager only
-- delivers to the topmost widget, so nothing further sees it).
function BookshelfWidget:handleEvent(event)
    -- Two dispatch problems to fix, both stemming from KOReader's
    -- UIManager:sendEvent only delivering events to the topmost widget

    --
    --   1. Gesture events (input → onGesture). See block comment above
    --      for the filtered FM-zone walk that handles these.
    --
    --   2. Dispatcher-emitted action events (e.g. IncreaseFlIntensity
    --      from a brightness gesture, ToggleNightMode, etc.). These are
    --      sent via UIManager:sendEvent and die in our widget. For any
    --      non-gesture event we don't consume ourselves, forward it to
    --      fm:handleEvent so FM's registered modules (DeviceListener,
    --      etc.) get a chance. Side-effect: events delivered via
    --      broadcastEvent (Suspend, Resume, etc.) get double-handled --
    --      FM gets them via the broadcast loop AND via our forward.
    --      Accepted because the relevant broadcast events are idempotent.

-- softRefresh — lightweight return-to-bookshelf update. Splits the work

-- book, which is the dominant thing that changed during the reader
-- session) and the shelf swap (deferred ~150ms, much heavier because of
-- the fetch + sort + BIM hydration).
--

-- the existing shelves still on screen, then re-sorts a moment later. A
-- full _rebuild() would have held the EPDC on a black screen for the
-- whole fetch+sort cost.
--
-- The shelf swap is further gated on _needsReaderReturnShelfRefresh: most
-- chip+sort combos can't have their visible order changed by a single
-- book closing (e.g. All sorted by title), so for those the deferred
-- swap is skipped entirely. The just-closed book's spine briefly shows
-- a stale progress bar until the next page-flip / chip switch — a fair
-- trade for a snappier return.

-- ─── Status-line auto-refresh ───────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Two refresh paths, both targeting the hero's right column (the cover
-- stays untouched):
--
--   1. A minute-aligned heartbeat for tokens that drift purely with
--      wall-clock time (clock, dates, time-left projections, battery %).
--   2. Event handlers for state that changes asynchronously (charging,
--      network, frontlight) — these get a 0.3s debounce so a slider drag
--      doesn't fire ten setDirty calls in a second.
--
-- Both paths gate on whether any *active* region template actually uses
-- a token from the relevant set. If your status line is e.g. just
-- `%title`, the minute heartbeat correctly stays silent — saves e-ink
-- ghost-refreshes and Lua wakeups.
--
-- The timer's callback is stored on self so UIManager:unschedule can
-- pull it out of the queue cleanly when the widget is closed or pushed
-- to the background by ReaderUI; not just bail on next fire (which
-- still costs a per-minute wakeup during a long read).

-- Tokens whose displayed value drifts with time alone — caught by the
-- minute heartbeat. Battery percent is here because the icon glyph
-- changes via Charging/NotCharging events but the numeric % only drifts
-- as time passes.

-- reading until the cache expired naturally. The fix is to mark the
-- cache expired here, before queueing the repaint, so the upcoming
-- _buildDeviceState forces a fresh PowerD / NetMgr read. The TTL still
-- coalesces unrelated rapid rebuilds (preview taps, _rebuild bursts);

-- ─── Experimental: next-page cover preload ───────────────────────────────
-- Cold pages are slow because each cover is decoded (BIM zstd) + scaled on
-- first paint. When the "Preload next page" setting is on, after a page-turn
-- settles we warm the NEXT page's covers (in the direction last paged) into
-- ScaledCoverCache during idle time, so the following turn paints from cache.
--
-- KOReader is single-threaded, so this is a CHUNKED deferred task: a couple
-- of covers per scheduled tick, re-armed until done. It yields to input
-- between chunks and is cancelled the instant the user pages again, switches
-- chip, opens a book, or the widget rebuilds/closes.
--
-- OOM safety (this plugin has crashed on large Series/Authors/Genres
-- libraries before): warms at most one page, optionally one page of each
-- OTHER chip; routes through the bounded LRU cache; and NEVER calls
-- buildBookMeta for off-screen books -- group drilldowns are sliced straight
-- from the payload, search is skipped, and every other path fetches lazily
-- (no cover decode) then decodes one cover at a time, freeing the source bb
-- after scaling.

-- cover decodes can hold the main thread 200-600ms per 50ms tick, so taps
-- land with visible lag for several seconds right after the boot paint --

--
-- Why one level deep, not full recursion: a file added at
-- ~/calibre/Author/Book.epub bumps Author/'s mtime but NOT calibre/'s,
-- so a single stat on home_dir alone misses ~all real sideloads. One
-- level of subdirs catches the calibre/per-author layout that 90% of

-- need an explicit swipe-down -- recursing would defeat the "cheap"
-- property the user asked for. ~10-50 stats per tick, ~0.5ms each on
-- Kindle, total under 25ms.
--
-- Power: cancelled in onSuspend (via _stopStatusTimer), restarted in

-- pair makes sure the poll doesn't fire while the device is meant to

-- The chip switch sent the user to a wrong tab on rebuild; the chip-
-- fallback logic then re-pointed them at their first tab. Easier and
